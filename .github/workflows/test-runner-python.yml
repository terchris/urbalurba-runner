#
# Purpose:
# This GitHub Actions workflow runs a simple Python test from the repository.
# It verifies that the Python environment is correctly set up and can execute
# basic scripts as part of the CI process. Specifically, it runs the
# 'hello-world.py' script, which outputs a greeting and the current time.
#
# Workflow usage:
# This workflow is triggered on any push or pull request to the 'main' branch.
# It sets up the required environment and runs the Python script from
# 'tests/python/hello-world.py'.
